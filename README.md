## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adhilsalim/CS-Assistant/main/readme_banner.jpeg)

CS Assistant is an online web-based assistant made for my classmates.
This is not a complete project, only a few features are available now.

My Expectations are üòÅ.....

On creating accounts, the students will be asked to fill out a form containing several personal questions. Those responses are then used to understand the personality and behavior of the student. The assistant will help the students to follow up their academic and non-academic activities. These suggestions are made by understanding how other students are following the particular task and the data collected on creating the account. On each suggestion feedback is collected from the student to create better suggestions in the future. 

The assistant will track how the student is performing such as completion of task, following up a task, and then these are compared with other students.

Students can create a to-do list within the website. We will be using an efficient way to create and manage to-do lists from traditional to-do lists.
The to-do list will have several fields to determine the importance and priorities of each task and then generate possible suggestions.

Students can decide the visibility of each task, such as for an exam the visibility can be set to public. Assistant will look for public tasks such as assignments, exams, notebook submission etc. to suggest those students who might have missed it.

The currently implemented feature is timetable, the timetable tab shows the detailed view of timetable. Timetables are organized into different sections such as Now, Upcoming, Previous. An entire week's timetable can also be seen. Each section contains details about the hour name, time, hour number, also it shows the upcoming class of the current subject/course. There will be an option to see the timetable of a particular day.

Teachers can easily modify the default timetable by just drag and drop. Teachers and students can see how many hours are taken for a subject/course.

Teachers can assign exams, assignments etc. easily allowing them to see already assigned works and workload suggestions.
